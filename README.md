This is the client for MiniEden. It requires a server to fully function. This code base uses Goolge App Engine mostly
 only for ease of prototyping and live hosting the files. I will also eventually add a prototyping convenience feature
 I developed during another project whereby the GAE python server feeds files names via jinja templeting into my HTML
 file which then uses requireJS to automatically load up any files added to specific servers. Almost like working
 in java!
